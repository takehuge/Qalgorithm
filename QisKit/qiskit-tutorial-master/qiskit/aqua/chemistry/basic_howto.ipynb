    "Next, we create a Python dictionary to specify the problem we want to solve. There are defaults for many additional values that are not show here for simpicity. Indeed we take advantage of using sensisble defaults that the qischem stack provides to help us here.  Please notice that the Qiskit Aqua Chemistry GUI allows for automatic extraction of the Python dictionary reflecting the current configuration.  Once the Python dictionary has been extracted, it can be pasted into a Python program or a Jupyter Notebook and, if necessary, edited.\n",

    "The first entry names a chemistry driver. This example uses HDF5 and the next line configures the driver for an hdf5 file that contains data from a prior computation for an H2 molecule with basis set sto-3g. The operator line would default but I have added it here to show it and to say that this is where the problem is converted into a quantum qubit form. We then have a VQE algorithm, using the COBYLA optimizer with a UCCSD variatonal form and initial state of HartreeFock. VQE is Variational Quantum Eigensolver and as its name suggests uses a variational method to find the mimimum eigenvalue of the problem, which in this case is the ground state energy of the molecule."
