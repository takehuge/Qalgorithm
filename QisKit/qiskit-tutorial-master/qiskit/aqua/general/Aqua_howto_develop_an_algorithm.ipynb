    "This notebook is part of the simple example of an algorithm for `Qiskit Aqua`. This samaple, called `Evolution Fidelity`, illustrates how to implement an algorithm and what steps to take to configure and run it. The implementation of the algorithm itself is located in the `evolutionfidelity` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: This notebook explicitly registers the example algorithm. If instead the register_algorithm is commented and the implementation folder `evolutionfidelity` moved/copied  under `qiskit_aqua` then the algorithm will be automatically discovered and explicit registration is not needed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the above done, we can easily get an instance of the algorithm as well as a random initial state to be used for checking quantum evolution fidelity, as follows."
