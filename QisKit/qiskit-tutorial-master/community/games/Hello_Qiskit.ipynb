    "If you prepared the state suggestion by the exercise, you will have found a significant violation of the upper bound for `P['HH']`. So what is going on here? The chain of logic we based the Bell test on obviously doesn't apply to quantum variables. But why?\n",

    "\n",
    "    hash2bit ( A, H ) = hash2bit ( A, V )        (4)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here we compare the value we'd get from an `H` type of hash of the variable `A` with that for a `V` type hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classical variables, this is perfectly sensible. There is nothing stopping us from calculating both hashes and comparing the results. Even if calculating the hash of a variable changes the variable, that's not a problem. All we need to do is copy it beforehand and we can do both hashes without any issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is not true for quantum variables. The result of the hashes is not known until we actually do them. It's only then that the qubit actually decides what bit value to give. And once it decides the value for one type of hash, we can never determine what it would have decided if we had used another type of hash. We can't get around this by copying the quantum variables either, because quantum variables [cannot be copied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem). This means there is no context in which the values `hash2bit(A,H)` and `hash2bit(A,V)` are well-defined at the same time, and so it is impossible to compare them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another hidden assumption is that `hash2bit(A,hash)` depends only on the type of hash chosen for variable `A`, and not the one chosen for variable `B`. This is also perfectly sensible, since this exactly the way we set up the `hash2bit()` function. However, the very fact that the upper bound was violated does seem to imply that each variable knows what hash is  being done to the other, so they they can conspire to give very different behaviour when both have a `H` type hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even so, the effect is subtle. It is impossible to determine which variable is affecting which: You can change the order in which the hashes are done, or [effectively do them at the same time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopholes_in_Bell_test_experiments#Communication,_or_locality), and you'll get the same results. This means that it not clear whether we can say they affect each other (see [here](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/2028/is-it-true-to-say-that-one-qubit-in-an-entangled-state-can-instantaneously-affec) for some discussion). But what we can say is that they are [contextual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_contextuality): to fully understand results from one variable, it is sometimes required to look at what was done to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this goes to show that quantum variables don't always follow the logic we are used to. They follow different rules, the rules of quantum mechanics, which will allow us to find ways of performing computation in very different ways than we are used to."
